    "To play a hand of Blackjack the following steps must be followed:\n",
    "1. Starts with a deck 52 cards\n",
    "2. Shuffles the deck\n",
    "3. Asks the Player for their bet\n",
    "4. Makes sure that the Player's bet does not exceed their available chips\n",
    "5. Deals two cards to the Dealer and two cards to the Player\n",
    "6. Shows only one of the Dealer's cards, the other remains hidden\n",
    "7. Shows both of the Player's cards\n",
    "8. Asks if the Player wish to Hit, and take another card\n",
    "9. If the Player's hand doesn't Bust (go over 21), ask if they'd like to Hit again.\n",
    "10. If a Player Stands, play the Dealer's hand. The dealer will always Hit until the Dealer's value meets or exceeds 17\n",
    "11. Determines the winner and adjust the Player's chips accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Idea - Playing Cards\n",
    "A standard deck of playing cards has four suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Spades and Clubs) and thirteen ranks (2 through 10, then the face cards Jack, Queen, King and Ace) for a total of 52 cards per deck. Jacks, Queens and Kings all have a rank of 10. Aces have a rank of either 11 or 1 as needed to reach 21 without busting. "
